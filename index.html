    <h2>The Legend
    </h2>
    <p>Van Gogh has influenced generations of young artists worldwide since his time. Today we can see his impact in painting, in poetry, in song and in video. We are happy to display new examples of art that were influenced by Van Gogh in our community art section.

      Tragically, Van Gogh died not knowing the acclaim his art would receive. Today his legacy is immortal, and he will be forever known as one of the greatest artists of the modern era. Through this website, The Van Gogh Gallery aims to share his life and legacy with the world.</p>
